#Project Overview
   The Amazon Global Dashboard developed using Power BI offers a comprehensive analysis of sales data across various dimensions to provide insights into sales projections, product units, key performance indicators (KPIs), sales by segment, market, region, profit by customer name, and top/bottom performing products. This project aims to showcase proficiency in data visualization, analytics, and business intelligence using Power BI

#Project Details:​
Thorough Analysis: I conducted a comprehensive examination of net sales performance, analyzing data across multiple dimensions, including year, customer, market, product, growth, and division. By diving deep into these various facets of sales data, I gained a holistic understanding of Amazon's global sales landscape.

• Target Alignment: Ensured alignment with strategic objectives by closely scrutinizing market performance against predefined targets. By comparing actual sales figures with target metrics, I identified areas of overperformance and underperformance, allowing for targeted adjustments to sales strategies and resource allocation.

• In-Depth Insights: Generated comprehensive insights illuminating critical aspects of sales operations. Through detailed analysis, I uncovered trends, patterns, and correlations within the sales data, providing valuable insights into customer behavior, market dynamics, product performance, and growth opportunities.

• Tools Used: Exclusively employed Power BI for data visualization, analysis, and dashboard creation. Leveraging Power BI's intuitive interface and powerful features such as data modeling, DAX expressions, and interactive visualizations, I efficiently transformed raw sales data into actionable insights. The resulting dashboard provided stakeholders with an interactive and user-friendly platform to explore and understand sales performance metrics effectively.
